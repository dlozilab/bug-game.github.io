# Bug Squish Icebreaker

## What is "Bug Squish"?

Welcome to **Bug Squish**, a simple, interactive game designed as an icebreaker for our new developer team!

The concept is easy: players have **60 seconds** to _squish_ as many bugs (🐞) as they can by clicking on them as they pop up on the screen. Each successful squish reveals a fun, thought-provoking **icebreaker question** that the player answers for the group.

## How to Play

1. **Gather the Team:** Get everyone together around one screen.
2. **Start a Round:** One person takes control and clicks the **"Start Game"** button.
3. **Squish the Bugs:** Click on the 🐞 emoji as quickly as you can when it appears in one of the holes.
4. **Answer the Question:** When a question modal pops up, the current player reads it aloud and shares their answer with the team.
5. **Pass it On:** After the 60-second round ends, the next person in the group takes a turn.

## Why This Icebreaker?

Starting a new role can be daunting. The goal of this icebreaker isn't just to have fun, but to foster a **positive and collaborative environment** from day one. Here’s why we chose this format:

### ✅ It's Relevant and Fun  
The "bug squishing" theme is a lighthearted nod to a universal developer experience. It's a playful way to connect over a shared concept without any of the stress.

### ✅ It Encourages Openness  
The questions are designed to be low-pressure, covering a mix of tech-related and personal topics. This helps team members learn about each other's personalities, interests, and communication styles.

### ✅ It Builds Psychological Safety  
A team that feels comfortable sharing and being themselves is more likely to collaborate effectively, ask for help, and innovate. This game is a small first step in building that trust.

### ✅ It's Energetic  
Instead of a traditional, static Q&A session, the game format adds a bit of **friendly competition and energy** to get everyone engaged and smiling.

Ultimately, the goal is to **break down initial barriers** and start building the personal connections that turn a group of individuals into a **cohesive and supportive team**.
